### 🌟 About Me  
🎓 **Senior at Penn State University** — *B.S. Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics (Aug 2022 – May 2026)*  
🧠 AI-focused backend engineer building **reliable, production-grade systems**—from **autonomous vehicle perception pipelines** to **self-healing AI platforms**.  
⚙️ Skilled in **RAG architectures**, **LLMs**, **vector databases**, and **agent-driven backends** that prioritize correctness, observability, and recovery.  
🔬 Previously worked on **reinforcement learning for multi-stage LLM verification pipelines**.

---

### 🧩 Featured Projects  

- **Self-Heal System** — Built an AI-driven backend using Flask, LangChain, and FAISS that captures error contexts, retrieves similar incidents, and recommends fixes with severity-aware Slack alerts and a chatbot interface.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Designed a protocol enabling LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step workflows across APIs, file systems, and databases—supporting tool orchestration and failure recovery.

- **Prompt Tracer** — Browser-based observability tool that tracks, evaluates, and optimizes prompts across ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini with real-time scoring and feedback.

- **Swipeflix** — Interactive movie/TV recommender that learns user preferences through quiz-based profiling and swipe feedback, improving prediction accuracy with TensorFlow.js.

- **Real-Time Collision Detection Engine** — Implemented spatial hashing for broad-phase collision detection in JavaScript, eliminating ~98% of unnecessary pair tests and achieving up to 50× faster performance than brute force (with identical collision output).

### 💼 Experience  

- **HCLTech – GenAI Intern** *(May 2025 – Aug 2025)*  
  Developed an **agentic self-healing backend** (Flask + LangChain + FAISS) reducing resolution time by ~50%.  
  Built a **7-category error classifier** with severity-based Slack alerts and chatbot-assisted triage.  
  Automated multi-API workflows via MCP and integrated Confluence ingestion for contextual document retrieval.

- **Research Assistant – Reinforcement Learning for LLMs** *(Sep 2024 – Dec 2025)*  
  Designed an RL-driven framework for multi-stage LLM pipelines to improve code verification via iterative refinement.  
  Integrated compiler verification tooling (Klee, CodeQL) for automated validation and self-correction.

- **Penn State Advanced Vehicle Team (AVT) – Perception Member** *(Feb 2025 – Dec 2025)*  
  Optimized perception accuracy using Kalman and particle filtering for traffic signs, lane markings, and obstacles in ROS2 pipelines.  
  Debugged LiDAR–camera overlays and validated modules in simulation.

---

### 🏅 Achievements  
- 🏆 **Dean’s List** — Fall 2023, Spring 2024, Fall 2025  
- 🎓 **Certified:** *AI For Everyone* – DeepLearning.AI  
- 🤝 Collaborated with cross-disciplinary research and engineering teams across **USA, India, and Germany**
