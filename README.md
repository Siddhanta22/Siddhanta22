## What I Build

I build AI-native backend systems that are reliable, observable, and capable of recovering from failure.

My work sits at the intersection of agentic AI systems, RAG architectures, autonomous perception pipelines, and evaluation tooling for LLM reliability. I am particularly interested in building systems that do not just produce outputs, but understand, verify, and improve their own behavior over time.

## Selected Projects

### Self-Heal System
An AI backend that captures runtime errors, retrieves similar past incidents from a vector database, and recommends fixes with severity-aware Slack alerts and a chatbot triage interface.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
A protocol that enables LLMs to execute multi-step workflows across APIs, files, and databases with tool orchestration and failure recovery.

### Prompt Tracer
A browser-based observability tool that tracks and evaluates prompts across multiple LLM platforms with real-time scoring and feedback.

### Swipeflix
A movie and TV recommender that learns user preferences through quiz profiling and swipe feedback using TensorFlow.js.

### Real-Time Collision Detection Engine
A spatial hashing engine in JavaScript that removes most unnecessary collision checks and achieves significant speedups over brute force approaches.

## Experience

**GenAI Intern — HCLTech (Summer 2025)**  
Built an agentic self-healing backend that reduced issue resolution time by about 50 percent. Designed error classifiers, Slack triage bots, and MCP workflows with document ingestion.

**Research Assistant — Reinforcement Learning for LLM Verification**  
Worked on reinforcement learning pipelines for multi-stage LLM code verification using Klee and CodeQL.

**Perception Member — Penn State Advanced Vehicle Team**  
Improved traffic sign, lane, and obstacle detection using filtering techniques in ROS2 perception pipelines. Debugged LiDAR and camera overlays in simulation.

## Interests

I am currently exploring agentic backends with reliability guarantees, evaluation frameworks for LLM correctness, and systems that can explain why they fail and recover from those failures.

Growth happens when curiosity meets execution.
