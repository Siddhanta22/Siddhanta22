# 👋 Hi, I'm Siddhanta Mohanty

🎓 Senior at **Penn State University**  
🧠 Major in **Computer Science**, Minor in **Mathematics**  
🚀 I build intelligent, backend-powered systems using AI, automation, and data to solve real-world challenges.

## 💡 What I'm Working On

- 🧠 **Self-Healing Systems**: Built a backend that uses GPT-4o, vector databases (FAISS), and LangChain agents to diagnose and explain system errors in real time—complete with a chatbot interface.
- 📸 **Photobot**: Created an AI assistant that parses DSLR manuals and uses RAG to recommend optimal camera settings for dynamic conditions like concerts or night photography.
- 🧰 **MCP Agent System**: Designed a Model Context Protocol that lets LLMs autonomously execute multi-step workflows across APIs, files, and databases.
- 🚗 **Autonomous Vehicles**: At Penn State’s Advanced Vehicle Team, I optimize perception algorithms (Python, C++, OpenCV, ROS) for object detection and localization.
